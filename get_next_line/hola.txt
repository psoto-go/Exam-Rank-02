Write a function named get_next_line which prototype should be:
char	*get_next_line(int fd);

Yout function must return a line that has been read from the file descriptor
passed as parameter.

What we call a "line that has been read" is a succesion of 0 to n characters
that end with '\n' (ascii code 0x0a) or with End Of File (EOF)
